### About My Project

My website is about everything PS4.
It has some videos of playing and even of the games being made. 
It also includes great pictures of the PS4 and the controllers.
It includes a homepage leading to all of the options and an info page about what you can do with it and some info about PSVR.
There is even a Te Reo Maori option which shows all the information in Maori (I translated it the best I could).
